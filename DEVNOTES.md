### Pokémon Cerise :cherries: Development Notes 

##### Random thoughts
* Play as a boy or as a girl
* Replace Pikachu completely
* Dex size: 201
* Fakémon? No.
* Prof -> Prof. Vitalba -> Studies ???? The effect of Pokémon on the environment?
* Fairy type (as a special type)
* No abilities
* No special split
* Rebalancing. Everything is a shitmon.


### Region
##### Gym leaders
* **CHEAPSHOTBADGE**: Dark-type, young kid is an asshole. The gym is full of traps that make you return to the beginning, or maybe fall into a lower room (Gym 8 Hoenn). Leader cheats (has very high lvl Pokémon, hard/impossible to win encounter) but after losing their master scolds them, and you have your rematch instead, this time fairly. The kid was using the master's Pokémon (and the wrong type). The master is a member of the Elte Four! (Ground? Poison? I was thinking some sort of ninja or warrior)
* **LOREBADGE**: Drago-type. Instead of battling the young girl, you battle through a dungeon beating several Fairy and Dragon type bosses, until you beat 3 different bosses (Druddigon, Dragonair and Salamence?) then battle the girl.
* **CANDLEBADGE**: A literal "Ghost" town! A seemingly void town that you must explore by interacting with certain odd Pokémon, in order to awaken Ghost Pokémon who were playing an illusion. Each time you beat one of them, the building returns to its normal state, until someone gives you a key to unlock the Gym, some sort of haunted house.
* **QUARANTINEBADGE**: Poison-type. Swamp. Somehow by exploring the city, you are prompted to reply to something, which makes them put you on a quarantine building along with other trainers who might or might not be sick. The leader is a doctor, who studies toxicity, in order to heal illness.
* **ALLOYBADGE**: A factory. Press the right buttons as you follow instructions to get free expensive items made for you but press the wrong one and face a trainer battle! A blacksmith. She's got a Scizor and Steelix. She also hands you a Metalcoat, an item she developed herself which seemed to make Pokémon evolve. Then she gets back to work.
* **---**: 
* **DASHBADGE**: Electric-type. A leader focusing on being very fast. Very sporty. 
* **TRUSTBADGE**: Last badge, I'd like to have the player choose between two characters to face. The League has recently shut down another gym and opened a new one, but they are still looking for a gym leader. The League has approached three rising star trainers with many badges and no responsibilities: Your two friends, and you. After beating both, you get to decline seeing as your big hope right now is the Pokémon League! So you get to choose with of your friends 

##### Maybes? Discarded?
* HUEBADGE/BRUSHBADGE/... An artist. Normal-type... Overdone.
* MANGROVEBADGE. Maybe if I take down the QUARANTINEBADGE dude, or gave it a non-swamp location.

##### Elite Four
* ---:
* **Earl**: 
* **Superhero**: Bug-type. Ledian is the Ace. 
* **Kid's Master**: Ground-type. Some sort of ninja? Flygon. Last member of the Elite Four.
