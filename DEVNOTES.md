### Pokémon Cerise :cherries: Development Notes 

##### Random thoughts
* Play as a boy or as a girl
* Replace Pikachu completely
* Dex size: 201 or 251, from all regions
* Fakémon? No.
* Prof -> Prof. Vitalba -> Studies ???? The effect of Pokémon on the environment?
* Fairy type (as a special type)
* No abilities
* No special split
* Rebalancing. Everything is a shitmon.


### Region
##### Gym leaders
* **CHEAPSHOTBADGE**: Dark-type, young kid is an asshole. The gym is full of traps that make you return to the beginning, or maybe fall into a lower room (Gym 8 Hoenn). Leader cheats (has very high lvl Pokémon, hard/impossible to win encounter) but after losing their master scolds them, and you have your rematch instead, this time fairly. The kid was using the master's Pokémon (and the wrong type). The master is a member of the Elte Four! (Ground? Poison? I was thinking some sort of ninja or warrior)
* **LOREBADGE**: Dragon-type. Instead of battling the young girl, you battle through a dungeon beating several Fairy and Dragon type bosses, until you beat 3 different bosses (Druddigon, Dragonair and Salamence?) then battle the girl.
* **CANDLEBADGE**: A literal "Ghost" town! A seemingly void town that you must explore by interacting with certain odd Pokémon, in order to awaken Ghost Pokémon who were playing an illusion. Each time you beat one of them, the building returns to its normal state, until someone gives you a key to unlock the Gym, some sort of haunted house.
* **---**: Grass
* **ALLOYBADGE**: A factory. Press the right buttons as you follow instructions to get free expensive items made for you but press the wrong one and face a trainer battle! A blacksmith. She's got a Scizor and Steelix. She also hands you a Metalcoat, an item she developed herself which seemed to make Pokémon evolve. Then she gets back to work.
* **MANGROVEBADGE**: Water-type. Join a friendly fisherman on a quest in search of a legendary fish! It's more of a Lake Ness thing, there isn't any. You control a boat sprite soaring through the water, and must interact with several bubbly spots and beat the fish Pokémon there. After beating all 3 mini-bosses, you find an enormous fish! It's just a... Big Magikarp!? After defeating it, the Fisherman challenges you... The price is the MANGROVEBADGE! Ace is probably a FERALIGATR! In the last scene of this trip, you see the real "legendary fish"! Milotic! The player character and leader never notice it though, hilariously.
* **DASHBADGE**: Electric-type. A leader focusing on being very fast. Very sporty. Something about helping Pokémon power-up some sort of generators.
* **TRUSTBADGE**: Last badge, I'd like to have the player choose between two characters to face. The League has recently shut down another gym and opened a new one, but they are still looking for a gym leader. The League has approached three rising star trainers with many badges and no responsibilities: Your two friends, and you. After beating both, you get to decline seeing as your big hope right now is the Pokémon League (non-verbally, I guess someone says it out loud for you lol)! So you get to choose which of your two friends stays and becomes a gym leader, and which one continues on to challenge the Elite Four and become Champion! Bittersweet moment for the one you choose, as they get to give up their hopes of keeping up with you and the other friend, but is also excited to be facing great trainers thanks to their new position.

##### Maybes? Discarded?
* A painter. Yeah, overdone.
* QUARANTINEBADGE: Poison-type. Swamp. Somehow by exploring the city, you are prompted to reply to something, which makes them put you on a quarantine building along with other trainers who might or might not be sick. The leader is a doctor, who studies toxicity, in order to heal illness.

##### Elite Four
* **---**: Fairy
* **---**: Ice
* **Superhero**: Bug-type. Ledian is the Ace. 
* **Kid's Master**: Ground-type. Some sort of ninja? Flygon. Last member of the Elite Four.
* **Champion**: The character you didn't pick for the TRUSTBADGE!
